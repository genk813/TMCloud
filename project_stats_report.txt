TMCloud Project Statistics Report
=================================

Based on manual inspection of the project structure:

1. DATABASE SIZE:
   - output.db exists in the project root
   - Also found: output.db-shm, output_backup.db, nonexistent.db
   - Exact size needs to be verified by running the Python script

2. NUMBER OF IMAGES:
   - Directory: images/final_complete/
   - Contains approximately 700+ JPG files
   - Files are named with numerical IDs (e.g., 1975114813.jpg, 2025047760.jpg)
   - Range appears to be from 1975 to 2025

3. TOTAL SIZE OF IMAGE FILES:
   - Each image is a JPG file
   - Total size needs to be calculated by running the Python script
   - Estimated: Several hundred MB based on typical trademark image sizes

4. .GITIGNORE STATUS:
   - File exists: YES
   - Contains appropriate entries for:
     * Database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
     * Image files (images/, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png)
     * TSV data files (tsv_data/, *.tsv, *.csv)
     * Log files (*.log)
     * Python cache (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
     * Virtual environments (venv/, env/)
     * IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)
     * Backup files (*.bak, *.backup)
     * Search results directory

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TEST DATA:
1. For testing, consider using a subset of images (e.g., 50-100 files)
2. Create a smaller test database with representative data
3. The .gitignore is already configured to exclude large files from git
4. Consider creating a separate test_data/ directory for development
